## [Unreleased]

Toward the 1.0 release. The v1 protocol and its three approval paths are
implemented and covered by the local end-to-end loop; production deployment
(OCI publication, CI, Homebrew/Debian packages) is deferred until the
protocol and local E2E stabilize.

### Added

- NATS JetStream request relay: the hook seals one exact sudo request per
  enrolled device, the server stores routing data plus opaque ciphertext in
  SQLite (WAL, single active server with one persistent database file) and
  relays verdicts, with idempotent redelivery and a transactional outbox
  that retries after restart.
- WebAuthn browser approvals: per-device sealed bodies served only to the
  device's own token, locally bundled browser UI, virtual-CTAP2 Playwright
  coverage, and HMAC-bound enrollment owned by the hook.
- Secure Enclave native approvals: `oshioki-agent` pairs with one enrollment
  URL, signs approvals directly with a P-256 key (Secure Enclave behind
  `biometryCurrentSet` on macOS, software key elsewhere), with Touch ID
  sheets, terminal prompts, fail-closed deadlines, and `run --auto` gated
  behind the `unattended` cargo feature for tests only.
- Sudo integration: `oshioki` hook binary plus `liboshioki_plugin.so` /
  `oshioki.dylib` approval plugin, with a prelaunch installer, supervised
  acceptance loops (`scripts/dev-acceptance`, including Mac approver over
  Tailscale), and production requirements for running it for real.
- Release packaging: amd64 `.deb` with systemd unit and postinst hooks, plus
  a Homebrew tap with bottles, published by CI from a version tag.

### Changed

- Renamed to Oshioki with private identifiers scrubbed.
- Dual-licensed under MIT OR Apache-2.0.
